TASK SUMMARY
============

Input File: /Users/max/Documents/code/proseRlm/experiments/oolong-pairs/input_task1_1M.txt
Total Lines Processed: 33,933

Task Description:
Find all pairs of user IDs (lower ID first, no duplicates) where BOTH users have at least one 
question classified as "numeric value" OR "location".

Classification Approach:
- Used pattern matching with regular expressions
- Numeric patterns: "how many", "how much", "when was", "what year", "what date", etc.
- Location patterns: "where", "what country", "what state", "which city", etc.

Results:
- Users with numeric/location questions: 4,889
- Total pairs found: 11,948,716
- Output file: /Users/max/Documents/code/proseRlm/experiments/oolong-pairs/output_pairs.txt

Output Format:
Each line contains a pair: user_id_1,user_id_2
Where user_id_1 < user_id_2 (lower ID first)
No duplicate pairs

Verification Examples:
- User 10012: Has location questions ("What country...", "Where can I get...")
- User 10025: Has numeric questions ("How many points...", "When was...")
- Pair (10012,10025) is correctly included in output

Formula: Number of pairs = n * (n-1) / 2
Where n = 4,889 users
= 4,889 * 4,888 / 2 = 11,948,716 pairs ✓
