In the above data, each line contains: User ID | Timestamp | Question

The questions can be labelled as one of these categories (the data does not provide the labels, you need to figure out the label from the semantics of the question):
- description and abstract concept
- entity  
- human being
- numeric value
- location
- abbreviation

List all pairs of user IDs (no duplicate pairs, list lower ID first) where both users have at least one instance with an entity or location.

In your answer, list all pairs in the format (user id 1, user id 2), separated by newlines.
